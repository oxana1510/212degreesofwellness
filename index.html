							<h2>About the <span>Doctor</span></h2>
							<p>Growing up, Dr. Jerod was active in many sports but his true passion was always soccer. In addition to many other injuries along the way, he suffered a career ending knee injury after his freshman year, playing collegiate soccer. The various injuries he suffered along the way and rehabbed from gave him a great appreciation for helping people heal so they could return competing or just living life at their full potential.</p>
